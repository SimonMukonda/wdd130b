            <p> Hello! my name is Simon Mukonda and I am
                from Gauteng
                South Africa. After weeks of straggling with this subject I feel like i am now begining to get the hung
                of it...
                I plan on Finishing my Bachelors degree in Software Development because I believe by doing so I  can
                open up a world of opportunities for me, both professionally and personally. Here’s why I need it:

                - Better career prospects – Many employers prioritize candidates with a degree, which can lead to
                higher-paying jobs and more career options for me.
                - Increased earning potential– I find that  people with degrees typically earn more over their lifetime
                compared to those without one.
                - Personal achievement– Completing  my degree is a major accomplishment that will  boost my confidence
                and sense of fulfillment.
                - Expanding knowledge– The skills and insights I gain will help me grow in my field and prepare me for
                future challenges.
                - Networking opportunities– A degree for me will create bases of Connecting with professors, classmates,
                and professionals  that can open doors to new opportunities.

                Ultimately, I  wish to achieve a sustainable value for myself and those around my association </p>
