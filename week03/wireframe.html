        <h2> Orange River Rafting for Students Route Plan</h2>


        <p>
            Over the next three days, you can expect to have spectacular mountain
            views, fast-flowing channels and excellent bird life. The River has a
            grade at level 1 â€“ 3 in difficulty and is suitable for beginners.
            The Orange River is a pool drop river, â€˜which means after every rapid,
            there is always a poolâ€™. The Richtersveld is home to goat herders trekking
            through the endless desert mountains. We donâ€™t have designated campsites
            and camp for the day depends on the progress made that day, where we will
            choose our overnight spot on the banks of the river. This is a great
            combination of rafting, relaxing, hiking and exploring.
            It is not a race, but rather an outdoor expedition suitable
            for all with no experience.
