                 <h2> Orange River Rafting for Students Route Plan</h2>


          <p>
            Over the next three days, you can expect to have spectacular mountain 
            views, fast-flowing channels and excellent bird life. The River has a 
            grade at level 1 â€“ 3 in difficulty and is suitable for beginners. 
            The Orange River is a pool drop river, â€˜which means after every rapid, 
            there is always a poolâ€™. The Richtersveld is home to goat herders trekking 
            through the endless desert mountains. We donâ€™t have designated campsites 
            and camp for the day depends on the progress made that day, where we will 
            choose our overnight spot on the banks of the river. This is a great 
            combination of rafting, relaxing, hiking and exploring. 
            It is not a race, but rather an outdoor expedition suitable
             for all with no experience.
